# Project Perceive :eye:
## Manufacturing data collectors stack.
Project Perceive is a full stack IoT platform to be used at manufacturing sites to collect machine data in the absence of SCADA and/or PLC's. The current state of the project is effectively, multi-input, wireless, remote I/O blocks; that is, 24V signals from PLCâ€™s or stand-alone sensors are collected and sent back to a database for analysis. The aim is to provide production with performance figures and maintenance with availability figures (with the end goal to present full OEE data per machine). These would be available in the form of web page dashboards.

# Stack Architecture
The current/existing stack:
* Edge/field devices: custom firmware on NodeMCU's (ESP8266).
* Messaging protocol, edge devices to server: MQTT.
* Messaging broker: Mosquitto.
* Messaging broker to database bridging: Python script.
* Database: MySQL.
* Server: Linux (Ubuntu) VM.
* Data visualisation: Apache serving PHP.

# Contributions
Project Perceive is a collaborative project within the Unipart Digital Champions network. Anyone at Unipart can [apply](https://www.unipartwayonline.com/systems-tools/digital/digital-community/) to be a Digital Champion meaning that anyone at Unipart can also get involved in Project Perceive.

# FAQ
Q: How is the project managed?

A: The project will be run in an open source manner. There are no specific milestones or timing requirements for contributors.

Q: Will I be required to visit particular sites to be able to contribute?

A: On-site work is optional. Obviously if you would like to install devices or undertake mechanical design change work then you will need to be on-site for those pieces of work.

# To Do
## PCB Design
- [ ] Use a ribbon cable or similar for the PCB connection as opposed to soldering free wires onto the board. The other end will still need to be soldered to the back of the DIN box screw terminals.
- [ ] How do faults on the PCB impact the interfacing machine? Should do a risk assessment and/or FMEA on the design. Polyfuses sound really good - have a look at them.
- [ ] Need to check what level of surge protection the device has - the DC/DC converter module may have already something but need to check (varistors? CVS diodes?).
- [ ] Verification of data - how do we confirm that there is no loss of data and/or false positives (noise)?
- [ ] What are EMC requirements that device needs to pass? Talk to York EMC external test house or other.
